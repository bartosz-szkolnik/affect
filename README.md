# Affect (a unnecessary copy of React)

Hello everyone. This is my attempt at this super cool [article/tutorial](https://pomb.us/build-your-own-react/) which teaches you how [React](https://react.dev/) (at least some part of it) works under the hood. In my attempt I also try to add some TypeScript on top of it, because why not? Right? 

## Hot to run it

- clone repository
- Run `pnpm i`
- Run `pnpm dev`
- Enter `http://localhost:5173` in your browser


Todo
- [ ] finish the tutorial
- [ ] type it properly (I think right now is too messy)
- [ ] Have some fun with it
